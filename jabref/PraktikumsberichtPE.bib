quire specialized algorithms to detect markers among other
features in a natural scene. The vision processing steps generally
dominate the computation time of a tag detection pipeline, so
even small improvements in marker detection can translate to
a faster tag detection system. We incorporated lessons learned
from implementing and supporting the AprilTag system into
this improved system.},

abstract="Camera calibration has the purpose to use the feature point coordinates (X, Y, Z) of a given 3-D space object and its image coordinates (x, y) in 2-D image space to calculate the internal and external parameters of the camera, thereby establishing the quantitative relationship between the objective scene and the captured image. This chapter will introduce the basic linear camera model, gives a typical calibration procedure, and discusses the internal and external parameters of the camera. This chapter will discuss typical nonlinear camera models, analyzes various types of distortions in detail, and summarizes the criteria and results for the classification of calibration methods. This chapter will introduce the traditional camera calibration method, analyzes its characteristics, and describes an example of a typical two-stage calibration method. In addition, an improved method is analyzed. This chapter will also introduce the self-calibration method (including the calibration method based on active vision). In addition to analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of this type of method, a simple calibration method is also specifically introduced.",
